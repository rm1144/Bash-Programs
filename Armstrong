This is a Shell script in linux to check whether a 3-digit number is an Armstrong number or not.

What is an Armstrong Number?
An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. 
For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3 = 371.

#! /bin/bash
echo "Enter a 3-digit number :"
read n
g=$n
k=0
while [ $g -ne 0 ]
do
j=`expr $g % 10`
g=`expr $g / 10`
j=`expr $j \* $j \* $j`
k=`expr $k + $j`
done
if [ $n -eq $k ]
then
echo "It is an Armstrong number"
else
echo "It is not an Armstrong number"
fi
