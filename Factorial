Shell Script to find the factorial of a number.

For an integer n greater than or equal to 1, the factorial is the product of all integers less than or equal to n but greater 
than or equal to 1. The factorial value of 0 is defined as equal to 1. The factorial values for negative integers are not 
defined.


#! /bin/bash
echo "Enter a number :"
read n
fact=1
for ((i=n;i>=1;i--))
do
fact=`expr $fact \* $i`
done
echo "Factorial : $fact"
