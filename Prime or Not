Shell script to check whether a number is prime or not.

A number that is divisible only by itself and 1 (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) is defined as a Prime number.

#! /bin/bash
echo "Enter a number :"
read n
flag=0
for (( i=n-1;i>1;i--))
do
k=`expr $n % $1`
if [$k -eq 0 ]
then
flag=1
fi
done
if [ $flag -eq 1 ]
then
echo "Not a Prime Number"
else
echo "Prime Number"
fi
